Planned for coming release
==========================

* Implement functional tests.

* Implement a page that lists the challenges a user has been clencher of.

* Implement a page that lists the challenges a user has been juror of. 


Likely coming in future releases
================================

* Abstract the currently hideous vote-comment system into a reuseable app.

* Implement hosted continuous integration via Travis.

* Implement hosted code coverage via Coveralls.

* Make a public API to create a challenge, get a list of challenges were the 
  user was a clencher, get a list of challenges were the user was a juror, ... .

* Make realistic, well defined challenge examples I can link to on the 
  challenge create page.

* Flesh out the tips on the side of the challenge pages.
  
* Implement a post challenge learning guiding and evaluation system.  
  The being successful/unsuccessful in learning 
  from a failed challenge should have a bigger focus than being 
  successful/unsuccesful in the challenge attempt. 
  Implement a sort of "what I should have done differently" field for the 
  clencher, were jurors can again vote and comment on.

* Allow users to make a challenge public. Before, during and after the challenge is 
  created. Then make a listing page of public challenges.

* Allow users to select and then show specific challenges they created to 
  hand picked users. The invited users get a "take a look"-mail. If the given email 
  address isn't assigned to a user yet, send a 
  "signup & take a look"-mail.
  
* Implement other time periods for a challenge such as two days (weekend) and 
  two weeks. I'll have to rename the application when I choose to do this.

* Implement a notification system for accounts so they get notified whenever a new 
  comment is made on a challenge page they are the clencher or juror of.

* Allow users full privacy control over their profile. By default, a user profile
  is not visible to anyone. 

* Implement a message system so users can send eachother messages without them necessarily 
  knowing each other's email address.
